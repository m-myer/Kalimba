# Kalimba

Kalimba is a webpage created using vanilla JS (radar chart in the song details view implemented using the chart.js library) and vanilla CSS that allows the user to browse through 400 songs, view their song data, and create/modify a playlist. The song list is pulled from an API, and each song contains analysis information from Spotify.
